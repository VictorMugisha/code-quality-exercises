# Code Quality Exercises

### Overview

This repository contains a collection of exercises focused on improving code quality. The exercises are organized into folders under the `code-improvements` directory.

### Folder Structure

1. **Folders**: Each folder is named after the function it contains.
2. **Files**: Inside each folder, you will find two files:
   - **Original Code**: This file shares the same name as the folder and contains the original code, as provided in the Notion page.
   - **Refactored Code**: This file also shares the same name, but with the suffix `New` added. It contains the improved and refactored version of the code.

### Example

If you have a folder named `calculateAverage`, it will include:
- `calculateAverage.js`: The original code.
- `calculateAverageNew.js`: The refactored code.

### How to Use

1. Navigate to the `code-improvements` directory.
2. Explore each folder to see the original code and its refactored counterpart.
3. Compare the two versions to understand the improvements made in terms of readability, performance, and maintainability.
